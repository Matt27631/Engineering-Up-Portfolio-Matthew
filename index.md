My second milestone was about how I got my car working with a remote control and able to move in all directions. This was done with arduino code and it was able to function fastly with IR sensor recieving signals.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I am able to have the car moving forward, backwards, left and right.

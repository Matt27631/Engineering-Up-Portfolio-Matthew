# Bob the robot project
My name is Matthew and i used the 3 in 1 smart car learning kit to design a car. Bob the robot is able to drive around and also work with a remote control. It was made during my time in Engineering Up and is able to play music. When I get older I plan to work for Nintendo as a game designer so Enginerring Up has helped me a lot. During my time here I did a lot of coding to allow my car to function, like causing my car to play music or to move in any cardinal direcion. My plan was to go in here and make a car that simply could move and thought it would be simple. I learned a whole lot and got through many challenges such as code not outpting or my music not playing. But by putting in the work got the car to move and also play music.

# Final Milestone

During my final milestone, I discussed how I made my car work with music. This was accomplished by using an active buzzer and wiring the buzzer to the ground pin on the Arduino board to provide power, and to pin 1. Now, my car can not only play music but also drive with the remote, as seen in the 2nd milestone. The code used can be found [here](https://github.com/Matt27631/Engineering-Up-Portfolio-Matthew/blob/gh-pages/Finished_code.ino.ino).

In my second milestone, I successfully programmed my car to operate with a remote control, enabling it to move in all directions. This was achieved through the use of Arduino code. The car's swift response to commands was made possible by an Infrared (IR) sensor, which efficiently received signals from the remote control. This milestone not only demonstrated the car's mobility but also showcased the effective integration of hardware and software in a control system.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I am able to have the car moving forward, backwards, left and right. This was done by using specific wires to cause an H-bridge to make the car go in a specific direction.
